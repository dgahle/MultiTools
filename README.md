# MultiTools
A general repo for data processing and statistical analysis tools in Python. 
This is a home for all the little (and not so little) functions and classes we wished where in bigger python packages, functions and classes that are in bigger packages but are unknown to the developers, functionality that was easier to reproduce than understand, and convient abbreviations for syntaxes that are not very readable.
